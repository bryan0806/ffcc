function Tune(project_name, overwrite_parameters, additional_code)
% Tune(project_name, overwrite_parameters, additional_code)
% Tunes the hyperparameters for a project. Given a project name, takes the
% current parameter settings that need to be tuned under cross-validation and
% performs crude coordinate descent of those parameters, one parameter at a
% time, while minimizing some cross-validation loss.
% Inputs:
%   project_name - The name of a project being tuned, which must correspond to
%     a folder in ./projects/.
%   overwrite_parameters - If true, open the current best Hyperparameters
%     file for the project (./{project_name}/{project_name}Hyperparams.m)
%     and dump the tuned hyperparameters directly into that file. If false,
%     dump the output into a new file in the project folder with a
%     timestamp's filename, which can be manually copied into the main
%     *Hyperparams.m file by the user. By default this option is set to true.
%   additional_code - an optional string of Matlab code that is evaluated
%     before doing this search, and so can be used to modify the project's
%     default parameters for experimentation. This code is included in the
%     output hyperparameter file as a comment. Because this code can include
%     matlab comments, this parameter can also be used to add comments to the
%     output file to make experiments easier to parse.
